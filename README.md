# PDFCombiner
Simple Windows PDF combiner tool

## Description
Combining multiple PDFs into one is a task any office worker will be faced with. This should be simple but it often is not. Sometimes you don't have the required software for it, are not allowed to install anything, and can't get IT to do it for you. In this case you could use an online combiner tool, but are those trustworthy? 
This tool is my solution to the problem. It's portable and open source. 
It uses iText 5.5.13 from here: https://github.com/itext/itextsharp/releases/tag/5.5.13

## Use
1. Put the PDFs to be combined in the input folder
2. Run the .bat
3. Take the combined file from the output folder
